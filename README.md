# Predict-Book-Prices-using-ML-Models


Thisreport exploresthe application of advanced machine learning modelsto predict book prices, leveraging a comprehensive dataset of popular Amazon books. With the growing need  for efficient pricing strategies in e-commerce, this study demonstrates how machine learning  can streamline decision-making and optimize pricing to enhance profitability. The dataset included features such as initial price, discount percentage, seller attributes, and  best-seller rankings, among others. It underwent rigorous preprocessing to handle missing  values using techniques like mean imputation for numeric data and filling categorical fields with  default values ("Unknown"). JSON-like fields were parsed and simplified to extract meaningful  information. Numerical transformations and categorical encoding were performed to ensure the  dataset was suitable for machine learning models. Feature engineering further enhanced the  dataset, with key predictors identified through correlation analysis. The study compared five regression models—Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost—evaluating their performance using Mean Squared  Error (MSE) and R² scores. XGBoost emerged as the best-performing model, achieving the  lowest MSE and highest R², showcasing its capability to handle complex interactions and nonlinear relationships in the data. Random Forest also performed well, making it a strong alternative forscenariosrequiring interpretability and robustness. The findings of this study underscore the transformative potential of machine learning in  automating pricing strategies. By leveraging such models, businesses can not only enhance scalability but also make data-driven decisionsthat optimize revenue and improve operational  efficiency. Key Points: • Purpose: To predict book prices accurately using machine learning models and evaluate  their applicability in real-world scenarios. • Methods: Preprocessing techniques included handling missing values, encoding  categorical variables, and numerical transformations. Regression models were  compared using key evaluation metrics like MSE and R². • Findings: Both Random Forest and XGBoost exhibited strong predictive performance,  with XGBoost demonstrating superior accuracy due to its ability to model complex  relationships. • Conclusion: XGBoost was selected asthe optimal model for book price prediction, with  the capability to integrate seamlessly into business workflows.
